# Anago - XenServer Console for Linux

Anago is a graphical user interface for managing Citrix XenServer, working on Intel x86\_64 Linux platform.
Though its functionality is limited as compared with Citrix XenCenter, Anago provides Linux GNOME desktop users with fundamental means for XenServer management.
This means that you can enjoy XenServer only with Linux machines; you don't have to prepare Microsoft Windows desktop machine just for hosting XenCenter.

Citrix XenServer is an enterprise-class, cloud-proven, virtualization platform available free of charge at [xenserver.org](https://xenserver.org/).
