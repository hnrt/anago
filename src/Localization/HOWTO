# How to update the localization files

0. Build tools once.

	cd $(PROJECTROOT)/support/src
	make both

1. Change the current working directory to $(PROJECTROOT)/src.

2. If one or more gettext lines were added or removed, update POTFILES in Makefile.

	sh ../support/scripts/update_potlist.sh Makefile

3. If one or more strings passed to gettext were changed, update po files.

	make po

4. Check updated strings in English po file.

	../support/bin/linux/release/pocheck Localization/en_US/Anago.po

5. Translate po files.

    1. If translations (msgstr) should be exactly the same as labels (msgid), just copy msgid to msgstr.

	../support/bin/linux/release/poupdate -copy Localization/xx_YY/Anago.po

    2. Otherwise, translate po file by hand.

	vi Localization/xx_YY/Anago.po
